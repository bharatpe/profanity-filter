# Profanity Filter

A module which filters profanicity. It provides a custom hook which returns a function isProfanicityPresent of type Promise<boolean> based on given text input.

## How to use the filter

Avoid using the filter on every input change because of heavy computation. Try using the filter with Debouncing or Throttling based on your use case.
