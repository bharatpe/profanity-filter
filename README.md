# Profanity Filter

A module which filters profanity. It provides a custom hook which returns a function isProfanityPresent of type Promise which gets resolved in either true or false based on given text input.

## How to use the filter

Avoid using the filter on every input change because of heavy computation. Try using the filter with Debouncing or Throttling based on your use case in case of every input change.
